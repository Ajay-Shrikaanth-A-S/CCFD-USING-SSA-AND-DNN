## Overview
This project aims to build an efficient credit card fraud detection system using a hybrid approach that combines the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) for feature selection and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for classification. The primary objective is to enhance the detection accuracy by optimizing the feature set and leveraging the powerful learning capabilities of DNNs.
